		<h1>Standard generator vs inverter generator</h1>
		<h2>What is clean “Clean” power</h2>
		<p>Before understanding the benefits of an inverter generator we must first discuss the concept of “clean” power. The power from a standard generator is not as stable as the power that comes from your mains at home. The electricity is generated from an alternator powered by a mechanical engine and so is vulnerable to fluctuations. Adding or removing appliances to the generator will increase and decrease the load and thus engine speed. The engine can also be affected by other external factors such as temperature and humidity.</p>
		<p>These variations may be minimal but they are important. The exact voltage of the currents will vary as the motor speed changes. Most standard generators will operate within 230V +/- 10% from no load all the way up to 100% of the quoted wattage. The same range can be typically expected from you main at home.</p>
		<p>However, the electrical frequency of the power output has a much wider range. Standard generators can expect a frequency variation from 52Hz with no load and 48Hz when running 100% quoted wattage. Your mains power should never vary by more than 0.2Hz.</p>
		<p>This stability in electrical Voltage and Frequency is what we call “Clean” power.</p>
		<p>Most electrical equipment will be able to handle these fluctuations with no problems, however other appliances are more sensitive. Computers, phones, printers, and even some kitchen appliances such as microwaves can be damaged by using unstable power. Advances in technology has resulted in many more of our home appliances using microprocessors making then vulnerable to surges. If you are are planning to power any of these surge sensitive appliances you need to take into account that a standard generator on it’s own will not be enough.</p>
		<h2>Why choose an inverter generator</h2>
		<p>Inverter generators use inbuilt technology ensure a consistent frequency as clean or cleaner than the electricity from your mains. A built in microprocessor regulates the power so that you can be confident in running any appliance directly from your generator without having to worry about damage caused by surges.</p>
		<p>The inverter in this type of generator converts the DC electricity produced by the alternator and converts it into AC power. AC power is what you would get from your main electricity in your home.</p>
		<p>Other than clean power there are a number of other benefits that tend to come with choosing and inverter generator over a standard model. The tend to be much quieter and will generally be more fuel efficient. However these benefits are offset by the price, for a comparatively power standard generator you will be paying around 20-30% more for these benefits.</p>
